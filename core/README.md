# Rustico - Core

This is the core library for the Rustico emulator, implementing the Ricoh 2A03 and 2C02, commonly found in the NES/Famicom and its clones. This crate has a design goal of zero external dependencies, other than the Rust standard library. This is still very much a work in progress, so while you're free to depend on it, bring a light and watch for grues. There is no stable API, everything is subject to change, etc. I'll try to at least bump the crate version number if I do any drastic refactoring. :)
