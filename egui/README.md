# Rustico - egui

This is an experimental, though rapidly progresisng, new frontend for the Rustico emulator. The primary goal is to replace the SDL build with a more mature framework, actual widgets, and a better stab at proper accessibility support. Extremely work in progress, barely anything works, etc.
